## What are the 3 most important attributes of a high-performance software engineering team?

* Trust is probably the single most important attribute. Without trust there are too many unanswered questions and uncertainty around solutions.
* Experience. In order for a team to always be moving fast they need knowledge around common problems and solutions to those problems. Otherwise, there will be more time required to research and verify solutions.
* Strong leadership. Without good leadership and alignment with the goals they share teams often find themselves swimming in circles or spending many cycles in code review/redesign.

## What do you love to do at work?

I really enjoy collaborating with my peers. Pairing with someone on a piece of work and hitting that "sweet spot" where you are riffing off of one another and eating through requirements is just amazing.

I also love mentoring and helping others. Watching colleagues grow from more junior states to capable feature leads is truly wonderful. Not to mention that as a teacher/mentor you are often forced to solidify your understands and even question what you know. It's this kind of symbiotic relationship that is just marvelous.

## What do you not like to do at work?

There is so much I enjoy about my job, but if I have to put my finger on the thing that brings me the least amount of joy... it has to be navigating politicial waters. It can be necessary, but I am an honest person who values integrity and often times navigating these rough waters involves compromising these ideals in some small way(s).

## Talk about a time that you required input from a co-worker who was not being responsive, but you needed to get their input for you to continue. How did you handle this situation?

I was in this situation just recently! While working on a bank integration I became blocked because the outlined test environment did not appear to be up and running on their side. I reached out to let the PM know that this would block being able to finish this feature. Now sadly it took a few days to receive a response, but in the meantime I simply moved onto my next task. In addition, each morning I would send a small friendly note to the PM asking if there had been any progress unblocking the integration. On the third day or so I received an apologetic response where the PM shared he had needed to take off a few unexpected personal days and he would be digging into this issue right away. I expressed my concern for his well-being and asked if there was anything I could do to help. The PM smiled and said, "nope, but thank you for asking." 

I've often found that remaining respectful, gentle, and helpful during these types of conversations keeps relationships positive and perhaps even grows them.
